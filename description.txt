Recursive Craft is a QOL mod that allows you to craft items directly without having to craft the intermediate (so you could craft a table with walls)

If too many craft are shown this way, you can configure the number of intermediate recipes that can be used (unlimited by default)
Compatible with Magic Storage Extra
